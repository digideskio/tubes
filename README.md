# tubes

**work in progress + side project == be careful**

## Huh?
A CLI tool that simplifies the creation of CF development environments on AWS

## Goals
- Automate as much as possible
- Minimize required human configuration
- Ease common existing workflows, don't try to replace them
- Encourage disposability of environments

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome.  Here's how to get started:

1. Get the source
 ```bash
 [ -d $GOPATH ] && cd $GOPATH
 mkdir -p src/github.com/rosenhouse && cd src/github.com/rosenhouse
 git clone git://github.com/rosenhouse/tubes
 cd tubes
 ```
 
2. Get dependencies
 ```bash
 ./scripts/get-dependencies
 ```

3. Build the binary (optional)
 ```bash
 go build
 ```
 
4. Run the offline test suite
 ```bash
 ./scripts/test-offline
 ```
 
5. Run the online test suite (optional)

 Requires AWS account region & credentials in your environment.
 
 ```bash
 ./scripts/test-full  # WARNING: this uses a REAL AWS account and will cost you real money.
 ```


## What it does today

*Given* I've set my `AWS_*` environment variables on an empty AWS account

*When* I run 
 
 ```bash
 tubes -n my-environment up && bosh-init deploy environments/my-environment/director.yml
 ```

*Then* I get a [fully-operational](https://www.google.com/search?q=fully+operational&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch) BOSH director on AWS

## What's in progress
- Deploy Concourse
 - Create IaaS resources required by Concourse (ELB + separate network) as a separate CloudFormation stack
 - Generate a Concourse deployment manifest

## What's next (maybe)
- Idempotent upsert, using data in state directory (see below)
- Optional hosted zone: DNS for everything
- Feature to rotate credentials?
- Deploy CF, somehow?
- Keep a log somewhere, for auditing?
- Generate a pipeline that idempotently deploys a CF on AWS
- Separate binaries for separate steps (package some as Concourse resources?)
  - CloudFormation resource supporting both `in` and `out`
  - Credential-generation
- For newbies: no ruby required, instead `ssh` to the NAT box and uses it as a bastion to run `bosh-init deploy` and `bosh deploy`
- For the paranoid: No external IP for the BOSH director, all access via bastion.

### Idempotency user stories

```
- Given the state directory is empty
- and there are no cloud resources
- When I run `up`
- Then I get a new stack and the state directory is updated

- Given the state directory is empty
- and there are no cloud resources
- When I run any other command
- Then I get an error

- Given the state directory is empty
- and there are some cloud resources
- When I run any command
- Then I get an error

- Given the state directory has content
- and there are no cloud resources
- When I run `up`
- Then the cloud resources get re-created and the state directory updated
- updated ips and ids are saved

- Given the state directory has content
- and there are no cloud resources
- When I run any other command
- Then I get an error

- Given the state directory has content
- And there are some cloud resources
- And there are no mismatches between them
- When I run any command
- Then it succeeds idempotently, updating both
```
